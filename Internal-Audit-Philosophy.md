## **1\. What is Internal Audit?**

According to the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA), internal auditing is:

"An independent, objective assurance and consulting activity designed to add value and improve an organization's operations. It helps an organization accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, control, and governance processes."

### **Key Takeaways:**

* **Objective Assurance & Consulting:** Provides an independent and unbiased assessment to help improve operations.  
* **Adds Value & Improves Operations:** Aims to enhance an organization's effectiveness and efficiency.  
* **Systematic & Disciplined Approach:** Evaluates and improves risk management, control, and governance through a structured process.

## **2\. Why Have Internal Audits?**

Internal audits are crucial for several reasons:

* To drive **continuous improvement** by identifying process weaknesses early.  
* To detect **nonconformities** early, preventing them from escalating.  
* To effectively **manage and mitigate risks** to product quality or compliance.  
* To ensure the organization is **prepared for external audits** (e.g., for ISO certification).

## **3\. Relevant Standards**

Internal audits often assess compliance against various standards, including:

* **ISO 13485:** Medical devices \- Quality Management Systems.  
* **PCI DSS:** Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard.  
* **IEC 62304:** Standard for Software life cycle processes.

## **4\. Internal vs. External Audits**

| Aspect | Internal Audit | External Audit |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Conducted by** | Employees or an internal team | Independent third-party |
| **Frequency** | As needed (e.g., quarterly, monthly) | Annually or per contract |
| **Scope** | Company-specific processes and procedures | Regulatory and certification standards |
| **Reporting** | Confidential internal report | Public report to stakeholders |
| **Follow-up** | Handled within the company | May require formal Corrective Action Plan (CAPA) tracking |

## **5\. The Role of an Internal Auditor**

The internal audit process involves several key phases and responsibilities:

1. **Planning and Scheduling Audits:** The preparatory phase before audit activities begin.  
2. **Collecting and Evaluating Evidence:** The fieldwork phase, where the auditor gathers documents, data, and other evidence to assess.  
3. **Conducting Interviews and Observations:** Key methods for gathering further evidence and understanding processes during fieldwork.  
4. **Reporting Findings Objectively:** After evidence is evaluated, the auditor compiles and communicates the results in a formal report.  
5. **Monitoring Corrective Actions and Closure:** The follow-up phase to ensure that identified issues are resolved.

## **6\. Governance**

Internal auditors play a vital role in assessing and improving an organization's governance. This includes:

* Assuring the effectiveness of performance management and accountability.  
* Promoting ethical conduct and upholding organizational values.  
* Facilitating coordination between internal and external assurance providers.  
* Communicating critical risk and control information to leadership.  
* Delivering timely and actionable information to support decision-making.

## **7\. Controls**

A primary function of internal audit is to evaluate the design and effectiveness of internal controls.

### **Types of Controls by Function**

* **Directive Controls:** Encourage a desirable event to occur (e.g., guidelines, training).  
* **Preventive Controls:** Deter undesirable events from occurring (e.g., access restrictions, approvals).  
* **Detective Controls:** Detect undesirable events after they have occurred (e.g., reconciliations, exception reports).  
* **Corrective Controls:** Aim to correct errors or irregularities after they've been detected (e.g., backup and recovery, audit trails).

### **Types of Controls by Level**

* **Entity-Level Controls:** High-level controls that address risks across the entire organization.  
* **Process-Level Controls:** Focus on specific business processes to mitigate risks within those workflows.  
* **Transaction-Level Controls:** Granular controls applied to individual transactions to prevent or detect errors.

## **8\. Risk Management**

Internal audit is fundamental to helping an organization manage risk.

### **Key Risk Concepts**

* **Residual Risk:** The risk that remains after management has implemented controls to reduce inherent risk.  
  * Formula: Residual Risk \= Inherent Risk \- Control Risk  
* **Audit Risk:** The risk that remains undetected after an audit is complete.  
  * Formula: Audit Risk \= Inherent Risk \* Control Risk \* Detection Risk

### **Risk Assessment Process**

1. **Identify Risk Events:** Understand the objectives of the area under review to identify potential risks.  
2. **Determine Inherent Risk:** Evaluate the likelihood and impact of risk events before considering controls.  
3. **Determine Residual Risk:** Assess how effectively existing controls and risk responses reduce the inherent risk.

### **Internal Audit's Involvement in Risk Management**

Internal audit's role has evolved from simply auditing processes to providing continuous support:

1. **Auditing the RM Process:** Provides assurance on the effectiveness of the risk management framework.  
2. **Providing Insight & Data:** Offers perspectives on past risk events to inform future assessments.  
3. **Active, Continuous Support:** Shares best practices, facilitates risk workshops, and offers expertise.  
4. **Supporting Management:** Collaborates with management to enhance the organization's risk capabilities and culture.

## **9\. Core Principles of Auditing**

The credibility and value of an audit rest on several core principles:

* **Integrity:** The foundation of professionalism.  
* **Fair Presentation:** The obligation to report truthfully and accurately.  
* **Due Professional Care:** Applying diligence and judgment in auditing.  
* **Confidentiality:** Ensuring the security of information.  
* **Independence:** The basis for impartiality and objective conclusions.  
* **Evidence-based Approach:** Using a rational method to reach reliable and reproducible conclusions.  
* **Risk-based Approach:** Focusing audit efforts on high-risk areas.
